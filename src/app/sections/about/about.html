                <p>22 year old from Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina. I started learning about Information technology and
                    various concepts as early as elementary school, but only with high school did I choose to pursue it
                    as a career. Over the years I've developed a will to learn and to experience new things and
                    concepts, which makes me open to all kinds of work. However, I'm most focused on <strong>Software
                        Development & Design</strong>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Besides Information Technology, I like to learn various new concepts & topics, and I like to say I'm
                    open to teamwork and communication (though I do preffer solo work). I always look to improve my work
                    & knowledge. I value <strong>precise, timely and strictly defined goals</strong> and I'm familiar
                    with time & effort organisation, which is something I've learned during my education & experience
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Below is a brief overview of all relevant things that I believe are important when it comes to
                    defining my skills & experience, such as <strong>education, experience, projects</strong> and more.

                <p>Worked as an intern software developer with a group, developing a solution to a private company task.
                    During my internship I primairly gained experience with working within a team with other skilled
                    developers, which gave me perspective on how to approach working and problem solving as a group,
                    rather than as an individual. I also gained experience with working on a large-scale project,
                    experiencing the pitfalls and the highs of quality code control and engineering principles. Besides
                    this, I learned a plethora of new technologies, along with going through all the necessary software
                    development phases (application design, frontend development, backend development, quality assurance
                    and control...)</p>

        <span class="text-center">For my personal projects (and hopefully for my carreer), I've chosen the following technologies as my favourite to use. It isn't just because of my experience in these, but simply because I find these to suit my style of coding the most. Those are: <strong>Angular</strong> for frontend development and framework of choice, <strong>Postgres</strong> as my database of choice, <strong>Java</strong> mostly with spring boot as my backend language of choice, <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> as my styling tool and <strong>Docker</strong> if I am dealing with custom deployment and imaging.</span>

I’m someone who loves to learn by doing, so projects are not something I’m short of. Time has been a problem for me due to personal reasons, however, I've managed to learn how to organise myself i the best way possible so that I can achieve the most in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>
        <p class="text-center">My projects range from tasks required during my time in university, to personal projects I've found to be interesting and intuitive for my learning. You can find both my coding and design projects labeled here on this portfolio webpage. They should give insight into my style of working and development approach.</p>
