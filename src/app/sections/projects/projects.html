                <p class="text-center">The best ways to learn coding and get into the flow of application developent is by making something yourself. This is the reason why I often opt to create small projects and components early on when learning a new concept as I feel it immediately gives me a good understanding of the entire framework/concept. I'm also someone who enjoys creating things that can immediatly be viewed and judged, hence why my preffered development area is Frontend Development & UI Design. While this is my personal favourite area, my work and experience in development has given me a broad understanding of a bunch IT topics, some of which are labeled here.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-center">As with coding, I value full-on work and project creation more than theoretical learning & small tasks. Design and art is something that has stuck with me ever since high school, and is something I value primarily as a hobby, but also as a career path. My experience in design has led me to have UI/UX design as my main choice of creativity, however, I do enjoy various other graphical design tasks, some of which are labeled here. Minimalistic and clean design is my preffered type of design, and it is a recurring theme in all of my projects.
